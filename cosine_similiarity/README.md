# Detailed Explanation of the Cosine Similarity Implementation for Text Files
## Key Features

### Text Preprocessing

- Converts text to lowercase
- Removes punctuation
- Tokenizes text into words


### Vector Representation

- Creates word frequency maps
- Generates a unified vocabulary from both documents
- Converts documents to numerical vectors based on word frequencies


### Similarity Calculation

- Computes dot product
- Calculates vector magnitudes
- Applies cosine similarity formula



### How to Use

- Prepare two text files:

document1.txt
document2.txt


- Run the program

It will read both files
Calculate cosine similarity
Output a similarity score
Provide a textual interpretation of similarity



- Similarity Score Interpretation

1.0: Identical documents
0.8-1.0: Very high similarity
0.6-0.8: High similarity
0.4-0.6: Moderate similarity
0.2-0.4: Low similarity
0.0-0.2: Very low similarity

- Key Methods

tokenize(): Breaks text into words
createWordFrequencyMap(): Counts word occurrences
createUniqueVocabulary(): Creates a common word list
createVector(): Converts frequency map to numerical vector
computeTextSimilarity(): Main method to calculate similarity

### What is Jaccard Similarity?
Jaccard Similarity is a measure of similarity between two asymmetric binary vectors or we can say a way to find the similarity between two sets. It is a common proximity measurement used to compute the similarity of two items, such as two text documents. The index ranges from 0 to 1. Range closer to 1 means more similarity in two sets of data.

It is denoted by J and it is also referred as Jaccard Index, Jaccard Coefficient, Jaccard Dissimilarity, and Jaccard Distance. It is frequently used in Data Science and Machine Learning such as Text Mining, E-Commerce, Recommendation System, etc.

It is calculated by the formula:
### Jaccard Similarity = (number of observations in both sets) / (number in either set)

or mathematically,

## J(A, B) = |A∩B| / |A∪B|

If two datasets share exact same members then their Jaccard Similarity Index will be 1 and if there are no common members then Jaccard Similarity index will be 0.

Jaccard Similarity will tell us that how much features are similar to each other in the dataset.

## The Jaccard Distance
It measures the dissimilarity between two sets. It is calculated as:

### Jaccard Distance = 1 — Jaccard Similarity

- Given a polynomial of the form cnxn + cn-1xn-1 + cn-2xn-2 + â€¦ + c1x + c0 and a value of x, find the value of polynomial for a given value of x. Here cn, cn-1, .. are integers (may be negative) and n is a positive integer.
- Input is in the form of an array say poly[] where poly[0] represents coefficient for xn and poly[1] represents coefficient for xn-1 and so on.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

- Auxiliary Space: O(1)

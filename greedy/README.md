The Activity Selection Problem is a greedy algorithm problem where we need to select the maximum number of activities that donâ€™t overlap, given their start and end times.

Sorting takes O(n log n), and selecting activities takes O(n), so total time is O(n log n).

Steps:

1.First, sort all the activities based on their ending times in ascending order.

2.Select the first activity (which ends earliest) as it leaves the most time for the rest.

3.Then, go through the sorted list and for each activity:

4.If its start time is after or equal to the finish time of the last selected activity, select it.

5.Keep updating the end time reference to the current selected activity.

6.Repeat this until you've checked all activities.

Used in CPU scheduling, conference room scheduling, and event planning to maximize task completion.
